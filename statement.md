# Medical Management System – Problem Statement and Scope

## Problem Statement

Small clinics often rely on manual registers for managing doctor and patient records, leading to inefficiency, errors, and difficulty in quick data retrieval. There is a need for a simple, secure, and modular digital system to centralize management of patient details, appointments, doctors, and medical histories.

## Project Objective

To design and implement a modular, Python-based console application for managing critical clinic operations, including patient records, doctor profiles, appointment scheduling, and medical history tracking.

## Scope

- Patient management (registration, details)
- Doctor management (profiles, updates)
- Appointment scheduling and viewing
- Medical history records per patient
- Menu-driven text interface with error handling
- Modular code separated by function

## Functional Requirements

- Register, find, and view patient and doctor details
- Schedule new appointments and view upcoming ones
- Record and display patients’ medical histories
- Validate input and handle errors gracefully

## Non-functional Requirements

- Standalone, console-based application
- Modular code (separated by feature)
- In-memory data structures, no database
- Ease of use for testers and reviewers

## Academic Relevance

This project demonstrates practical application of Python modules, data management, CLI user interface design, and robust error handling. Developed per VIT Bhopal first-semester BTech guidelines for original, modular programming projects with complete documentation.
